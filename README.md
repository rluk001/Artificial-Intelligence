1. Is unable to complete a grid that is 3x3 with two rewards and two penalties.

2. Is unable to complete a grid that is 2x2 and lower with one or more rewards and penalties.

3. There are multiple occasions on when one of the GridCells would go the wrong direction.

4. When there is only a path to the penalty, all of the values will update and cause directions to go randomly.

5. There are several occasions when the program is mostly wrong.
